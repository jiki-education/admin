## File Size Guidelines

**Maximum file size: 100 lines (110 max)**

Files should be kept small and focused. When a file approaches 100 lines, consider refactoring:

- Extract components into separate files
- Split large functions into smaller ones  
- Move utility functions to separate modules
- Create reusable components for repeated patterns

This promotes:
- Better readability
- Easier testing
- Improved maintainability
- Better code organization
